This file contains notes of things I would change and any extra information I think might be useful. 

I use text wrap for notes like this to myself. 

1. Not use Windows. I would have created a Linux VM and done the work from there. I did manage to get it all working on Windows it just took longer than I would have liked. Seemed like it would be a lot easier getting started on linux. I use powershell anyway so most of the interaction with the command line would be exactly the same.

2. I should have asked about priority. At first I assumed I would have enough time to get the whole thing done. I underestimated how long it would take me to learn to navigate and use a new framework. Learning Ruby itself was not too difficult since I am so familiar with Python. 

3. I would have watched the youtube series I linked below all the way through before attempting. I started off watching a bunch of tutorials on getting started with Rails and many of them had a much smaller scope. The series I linked is 38 videos and he explains everything such as: navigating the rails framework, nitch things to look out for (plurals), dynamically pulling info from the database and displaying it in on our webpages.
